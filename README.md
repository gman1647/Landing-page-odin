# Landing-page-odin
An Odin Project practice exercise: Landing Page. In this project I am to replicate a landing page based on an image of the page from scratch.

This project will conclude the HTML an CSS overview sections of the Foundations course.

For the header section, I added a column flexbox divided between the header log and links, and the impact font, text, button and image. Then each of those sections was turned into a row flex box. Still needs some fine tuning, but I'm happy overall.
